# PinTheSlug

**PinTheSlug** is a GeoGuessr-inspired web game where players guess UCSC locations.

## What is PinTheSlug?

PinTheSlug drops you into a random location and challenges you to pinpoint where you are on the map. The closer your guess, the higher your score. What differentiates PinTheSlug from GeoGuessr is its UCSC-bound map and its still images of locations that cannot be accessed from Google Maps' street view.
